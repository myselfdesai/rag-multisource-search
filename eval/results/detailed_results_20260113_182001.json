        "response": "The Transformer uses positional encodings to provide information about the position of tokens in the input sequence, as the model itself does not have any inherent notion of order due to its reliance on self-attention mechanisms. In the original model, positional encodings are implemented using sinusoidal functions, which allow the model to learn the relative positions of tokens effectively (Attention_is_all_you_need.pdf, page 2.0).",
        "reference": "The Transformer uses positional encodings because it has no recurrence or convolution and therefore lacks an inherent notion of token order. Positional encodings are added to the input embeddings and are implemented using fixed sinusoidal functions of different frequencies.",

      "answer": "The EU AI Act classifies AI systems into four risk categories: \n\n1. **Unacceptable risk**: This category is completely prohibited and includes systems such as social scoring systems and manipulative AI that deploy subliminal, manipulative, or deceptive techniques to distort behavior and impair informed decision-making, causing significant harm (EU AI Act Doc, Introduction, page 1).\n\n2. **High-risk AI systems**: These are regulated and include systems used as safety components in products covered by EU laws or those that profile individuals (EU AI Act Doc, Introduction, page 2).\n\n3. **Limited risk AI systems**: These are subject to lighter transparency obligations, requiring developers and deployers to inform end-users that they are interacting with AI (EU AI Act Doc, Introduction, page 1).\n\n4. **Minimal risk AI systems**: This category is unregulated and includes the majority of AI applications currently available on the EU single market (EU AI Act Doc, Introduction, page 1). \n\nThus, the category that is completely prohibited is the **unacceptable risk** category.",
