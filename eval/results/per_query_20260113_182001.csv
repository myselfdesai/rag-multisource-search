This behavior signifies the model's growing reasoning abilities and exemplifies how reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected and sophisticated outcomes. It highlights the model's capacity to autonomously develop advanced problem-solving strategies without explicit instruction, showcasing the potential of reinforcement learning to enhance intelligence in artificial systems (Deepseek-r1 (1).pdf, page 9.0).","The aha moment refers to a phase during reinforcement learning where an intermediate version of DeepSeek-R1-Zero learns to allocate more thinking time by reevaluating its initial approach to a problem. This behavior emerges spontaneously without explicit supervision and demonstrates the model’s growing ability to reflect, revise reasoning steps, and adopt more effective problem-solving strategies.

This approach enables the model to engage in self-evolution through a pure RL process, where it learns to solve increasingly complex reasoning tasks by leveraging extended test-time computation (Deepseek-r1 (1).pdf, page 8.0).

The reward system plays a crucial role in this process. It incentivizes the model to allocate more thinking time to problems and to reevaluate its initial approaches, leading to the emergence of sophisticated behaviors such as reflection and the exploration of alternative problem-solving strategies. This self-directed learning, driven by the rewards, enhances the model's reasoning capabilities and allows it to autonomously develop advanced problem-solving strategies (Deepseek-r1 (1).pdf, page 8.0).","DeepSeek-R1-Zero improves reasoning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which optimizes the policy by comparing groups of sampled outputs without relying on a separate critic model. Its reward system is rule-based and includes accuracy rewards to verify correctness of final answers and format rewards that enforce structured reasoning output, incentivizing longer and more coherent chain-of-thought reasoning without supervised data.",0.18181818181818182,0.8128322329432439,0.0,0.0,0.33006541578493054

2. **High-risk AI systems**: These are regulated and include systems used as safety components in products covered by EU laws or those that profile individuals (EU AI Act Doc, Introduction, page 2).

3. **Limited risk AI systems**: These are subject to lighter transparency obligations, requiring developers and deployers to inform end-users that they are interacting with AI (EU AI Act Doc, Introduction, page 1).

4. **Minimal risk AI systems**: This category is unregulated and includes the majority of AI applications currently available on the EU single market (EU AI Act Doc, Introduction, page 1).
